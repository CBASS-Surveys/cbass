\section{Introduction}

As with all software systems, CBASS must be tested.  To accomplish
this goal, we will primarily be using code coverage testing
(particularly statement and decision coverage).

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Interfaces}
Testing of the Interfaces (User, Software, and Communications) will
consist of using a browser to load a default survey that demonstrates
constraint functionality (\docsec{3.2.1.3.5}). The survey will then be
completed and exited (\docsec{3.2.2}).

\subsection{Data Collection}
Testing of the Data Collection process will consist of the same
process as described in the previous section, but will occur multiple
times with a different set of responses each time to probe the various
constraint functionalities of the survey (\docsec{3.2.1.3.5}). The Data
Collection will be fully tested once Database testing is also
completed.

\subsection{Database}
Testing of the Database will occur after completion of the many
responses of the Data Collection testing. It will consist of pulling
the recorded response data (\docsec{3.2.2.2}) out of the database to
ensure that it was securely stored, and outputting it in a readable
manner. It will also be checked for correctness, completing the Data
Collection testing.
